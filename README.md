# SVC_LED_Blinking
SVC (Supervisor Call) LED blinking typically refers to using a Supervisor Call (SVC) exception to trigger the blinking of an LED on a microcontroller. In ARM Cortex-M based microcontrollers like the STM32F407, SVC is a way to switch from unprivileged code to privileged code, often used in operating systems, RTOS, or when accessing system resources.
